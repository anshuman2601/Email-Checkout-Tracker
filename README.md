# Project: Remind me to take back my library items. 

This file is a great reference for you to use. If you with to follow along with more detail, I [created a video](https://youtu.be/fpDR7yalB2c) walking you through this file with greater detail. 

# Problem: 
I get emailed (example email attached), to my personal gmail, from my library when i check out books. it gives calendar date, if my account currently owes any fees, title of book, etc. i check out books and dvds. this email is not actionable. i need to remind myself to take back the book. I personally use my calendar on my phone for everything. 

# Your task: 
When I get an email from the library, remind myself to take back the book when it is due. 
* Yes, the directions are vague. I am not telling you exactly how to solve this problem. I can think of 10 different ways to solve this problem. Each with their pros and cons. It’s up to you to decide how to solve this problem.
  * I recommend, to take some time and sketch out a plan for how this piece of software should work before you begin to build it. 

# Technology to use: 
* Use whatever language, framework, library, 3rd party cloud service, you wish. Write as much or as little of code as you want to solve this problem using whatever tools and services you wish. 
  * I recommend using the lang that you are most comfortable with. 
* I have no rules about if you should comment your code or not. I want you to make all of those decisions based on your personal preference. The software team has these rules set, but I want to see your personal style here. 

# Todo list

* Create GitHub repository (private or public is up to you) to host your code. [Add me to it as a GitHub repo collaborator in the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
  * my github account is: `levibostian`
* Sketch out plan on how this solution should work. 
  * What solves the problem at hand, super well? 
  * What would make the user using this software happy? Make them smile? 
* Get to work! Build something. 
  * Do not stress out about finishing it if you feel you cannot do so. Do your best. If you hit technical roadblocks, try to solve them yourself. If you cannot get past something, leave it unfinished. 
  * Ignore making a pretty design. Make it black and white. Do, or don’t have a UI. Spend your time on the tasks that you feel are the most important to work on. 
* After building a solution (or getting as close as you decide to), I need you to create a video for me. 
  * Videos should be raw. Do not worry about editing or making anything perfect! It's just a way to communicate with each other :)
  * Demo your software to me. Show me how it works. Show me how it fails. 
  * What did you learn? What did you struggle with? What did you not struggle with? Did you try something new or use technologies you are used to? 
  * Did you use any libraries, services, tools, frameworks for this project? Why? 
  * Anything else you feel I should know about your software or your thought process? 
  * Upload video to YouTube as an unlisted or public video. 
* Create a second video. This video is different from the first video that was pretty technical. This video should take a step back from the code and tell me about the software. 
  * Tell me about your solution you decided to build. Did you create a mobile app? Did you create a bot? Did you do neither? Why did you decide to do that? 
  * Let’s ignore the code you wrote for a minute and tell me about the solution you want to build to solve this problem at hand if you had more time or more technical experience. What do you feel is the best solution to solve my problem of reminding me to take back my items to the library? 
  * I want this video to be more about your problem solving skills and not code. Think about the user and how you can build something to make them happy!
  * Upload video to YouTube as an unlisted or public video. 
* Create a file in the root directory of your code. Call it “README.md”. Inside of this file, put the links to the YouTube videos, your name, any directions that I need to build/compile/run your software on my computer. Anything else that I would find helpful. 
* Get all of this complete by June 11th at 12pm CST. I will be cloning your GitHub repo at that time and looking it over from where the project is at that point. 

# Here is what I am looking for: 
* Getting an idea of where you are at as a programmer and your skills. 
  * Most of the time, the simple solution is the best one. I would work on doing your best and not as much impressing me with technical skills you want to show off. I am more impressed by "beautiful" and "smart" decisions. Not some cool algorithm you made up. 
* Getting an idea of your problem solving skills. 
  * As stated above. This position is about building software for startups. Building software that is fun and solves the problem at hand is the most important thing. 

# Questions?

This is not a test. This is meant to get to know each other a bit more. You can ask me questions! 

Most importantly, this should be fun. If you enjoy working on this project, you will enjoy being a part of this team.

# SETUP

1. All files to remain consistent within the same folder as the python program is localized within the directory.

2. In this case, run the tracker.py program, either from your terminal or double-click the file.

3. In the next step, since this is pre-built, it is going to scan the email receipt automatically, and then ask for the reminder timeline(in Days only)

4. Since it does not have a GUI, this task will be performed within the terminal and display the results there.
